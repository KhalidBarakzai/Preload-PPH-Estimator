This Excel spreadsheet is a tool that factors multiple components of the operation such as flow rate, sort span, staffing, volume, and hours to estimate the operation's PPH. It can quickly be adjusted throughout the sort to give real time feedback to the management team on the trajectory of the overall production. It has assisted the Maple Grove Preload team in effectively executing a plan to meet production goals.
